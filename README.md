# Introduction
This application is the final project completed within Codecool Academy. Our task was to create a web application from scratch during six weekly sprints. At the end of each sprint, we prepared a presentation and presented our application to the entire group.
# About project
Act of Kindness web app connects users on a meaningful level (not like any other social media). We aim to link helpers with people in need and enable real-life interactions between them.

## Web app features
- Users can perform CRUD operations on Events
- Web app defines user roles - user, moderator, administrator
- Each event must be moderated before it reaches public
- Participants can use live chat for each event
- Web app implements logging in/registering users
- Each user can edit dedicated user profile page
- Integrated databases (for users and events)
- Easy picture upload
